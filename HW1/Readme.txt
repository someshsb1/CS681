• Recall a HW11-13 in CS680: Sorting Cars with Collections.sort() and 4 LEs.
– 4 LEs implemented 4 different ordering policies: price-, year-, mileage-, and domination count-based sorting.

Advanced work on the existing car assignment:

• In each sorting policy,
– Separated Cars to the “HIGH” and “LOW” groups with a certain threshold.
• Set custom thresholds for each category (price, year, mileage and domination count) 
– For each group,
• Calculated and printed average, highest and lowest values. 
• Calculated and printed the the number of cars.
