• Using the 3 types of data processing in HW5 same as HW5.
Implemented those data processing with 3 extra threads.
– One data processing with one extra thread.

• Have the main thread
– wait for 3 data processing threads to be terminated with join()
– collect data processing results from runnable objects.
